- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bwash15 and I am a Software Engineer. First and foremost, I am a father of 3 amazing children; Austin, Morgan, and Ciera.  I was blessed with meeting my son at the age of 18, he was 3 at the time.  I was then blessed with my first daughter at 21 and the youngest at 27.  Needless to say life took me in a different direction, down a path where my concerns were secondary.  That path earned me a lot of life experience gained from having to work my way up from the bottom.  I had only started college when I met my son, so I had to work to earn my credentials.  And I did just that... 
         Earning my first management roll after working in the corporation for 3 years, it was waiting for me when I turned 21.  The age limit for management.

 After 3 years of the 70 - 80 hr work weeks that the restaurant industry management positions require, I had enough and decided it was time for a 
 change.  I left to begin the next journey, my career as an Insurance Broker. Taking a job in Raleigh, NC, I was relocated by the firm to help out an
 office that was one of the busiest in the company but was having problems after merging another office.  We got to work day one and within 6 months 
 we had the office running like clock-work again.  Ranking as high as the #2 office in the company for profitability on a regular monthly basis.
 I was then asked to take on a new role that had just been created to help the owner open his insurance company to the state of North Carolina.  With         
 this role I would see the first glimpse of what I am here to do.  I worked with the IT director of the firm, testing new features and reporting any         
 bugs I might see or enhancements that might make the process more efficient from the broker side of the coin.  Studying the state insurance manuals         
 on rating profiles and insurance statutes I could approach the testing process with an real-world trained perspective
