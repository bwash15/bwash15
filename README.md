- 👋 Hi, I’m @bwash15 and I am a Software Engineer. The design and architect process of software is probably one of my favorites.  I am a father of 3
-         amazing children; Austin, Morgan, and Ciera.  I was blessed with meeting my son at the age of 18, he was 3 at the time.  I was then blessed with
-         my first daughter at 21 and youngest at 27.  Needless to say life took me down a path.  That path earned me a lot of life experience gained from
-         working my way up from the bottom.  I had only started college when I met my son, so I had to work to earn my credentials.  And I did just that... 
-         Earning my first management roll after working in the corporation for 3 years, it was waiting for me when I turned 21.  The age limit for management.
-             After 3 years of the 70 - 80 hr work weeks that the restaurant industry management positions require, I had enough and decided it was time for a 
-         change.  I left to begin the next journey, my career as an Insurance Broker. Taking a job in Raleigh, NC, I was relocated by the firm to help out an
-         office that was one of the busiest in the company but was having problems after merging another office.  We got to work day one and within 6 months 
-         we had the office running like clock-work again.  Ranking as high as the #2 office in the company for profitability on a regular monthly basis. I was
-         then asked to take on a new role that had just been created to help the owner open his insurance company to the state of North Carolina.  With this 
-         role I would see the first glimpse of what I am here to do.  I worked with the IT director of the firm, testing new features and reporting any bugs 
-         I might see or enhancements that might make the process more efficient from the broker side of the coin.  Studying the state insurance manuals on rating
-         profiles and insurance statutes I could approach the testing process with an real-world trained perspective.
